[bafview](http://www.xach.com/misc/bafview/) - display BAF files

(as packaged by [Zach Beane](http://www.xach.com/))

bafview is a program to read a Bellcore AMA Format (BAF) file and display its records in a human-readable format. It is copyright Â© 2005 [Data Connection Limited](http://www.dataconnection.com/) and licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL.

The BAF file format is documented by Telcordia document [GR-1100](http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&DOCUMENT=GR-1100&). This document is proprietary and expensive to license, so bafview is handy to extract data from BAF files in a pinch.
